Canoo has developed breakthrough electric vehicles that are reinventing the automotive landscape with bold innovations in design, pioneering technologies, and a unique business model that defies traditional ownership to put customers first. Distinguished by its experienced team from leading technology and automotive companies, Canoo has designed a modular electric platform purpose-built to deliver maximum vehicle interior space that is customizable across all owners in the vehicle lifecycle to support a wide range of vehicle applications for consumers and businesses.","
The very first bullet point in Canoo's (NASDAQ: GOEV) third-quarter 2023 earnings release stated that the electric vehicle (EV) company had reached the ""accelerating revenue generation phase."" That sounds great, and if you look at the income statement, it is clearly true. But there's still one small nuance to consider if you examine the company's 10-Q filing.Canoo finally has some incomeIn the third quarter of 2023, Canoo generated $519,000 of revenue, compared to zero in the prior year period. In fact, if you look back through the company's short history (it went public through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company in December 2020), the third quarter of 2023 was the first time it generated any revenue at all.

To give credit where credit is due, the third quarter was a big improvement. Until now, the company has just been trying to build its business. Getting to this point was no small feat, given that creating an EV company from, effectively, scratch is both difficult and expensive.That said, there are still some problems investors need to consider. For example, while it generated $519,000 in revenue, the cost of revenue tallied up to $903,000. So, the company's gross profit was negative. On top of that, the company is still spending a lot of money to build out its business. For example, research and development spending came in at $21.9 million, and selling, general, and administrative expenses were $24.9 million. Canoo continues to burn through cash.That is why, despite entering the ""accelerating revenue generation phase,"" the company's 10-Q for the third quarter still contained a going concern warning. This is a warning from a company that it may be unable to survive the next 12 months because of its weak financial condition. Here's what the filing said:
The Company expects to continue to incur net losses and negative cash flows from operating activities in accordance with its operating plan and expects that both capital and operating expenditures will increase significantly in connection with its ongoing activities. These conditions and events raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.




Canoo's situation remains riskyThere's no way to predict the future, but Canoo is clearly not starting from a position of strength. It is highly likely to need to sell equity or issue debt to continue to fund its business efforts. This isn't a maybe. It's a certainty. The company noted in the third-quarter 2023 earnings release:
As of September 30, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of $8.3 million. After giving effect to the preferred stock and warrant subscription agreement for a total of $45.0 million, our cash balance would have been $53.3 million on September 30, 2023.
Put into plain English, the company doesn't have nearly enough cash on hand, but it has agreements to sell preferred stock and warrants that will allow it to raise some much-needed money. Finally generating some revenue is good news, but there needs to be a drastic ""acceleration"" on the top line before Canoo will be able to self-fund its business. And since a going concern warning looks out 12 months, the next year isn't likely to see the company's financial situation change much.The worst part of all this is likely that at some point in the future, Canoo will have to issue shares to cover the convertibles and warrants it is relying on to generate cash today. That means current shareholders could potentially suffer massive amounts of dilution before Canoo gets its business profitable (if it ever manages to). The risk/reward trade-off looks pretty ugly right now, and only the most aggressive investors should be looking at Canoo.Canoo is not for the faint of heartBy Canoo's own admission, the next year will be hard financially. Buying the stock today means you must not only believe strongly that it can actually build a profitable business but also be willing to suffer more losses until it does. And even then, you will likely see material dilution as the company has to make good on the convertibles and warrants it has been using to fund its massive capital needs.




All but the most aggressive investors would probably be better off watching the company's progress over the next year than buying it. That will remain true at least until the going concern warning is removed from the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.Should you invest $1,000 in Canoo right now?Before you buy stock in Canoo, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Canoo wasn't one of them.

","Tony Aquila
Investor, Executive Chairman & Chief Executive Officer




Tony Aquila is an American businessman, investor, serial entrepreneur, and inventor associated with 100+ patents in the automotive, aeronautics and cybersecurity sectors.
Growing up on the fringes of Silicon Valley with a mathematical and entrepreneurial mind, Tony founded in his garage, grew, and sold several technology start-ups during the dot-com years, ultimately founding Solera in 2005. Solera is an automotive technology company, that Tony founded with GTCR as his capital partner. Under his leadership as Founder, Chairman and CEO, the company went public through a $1 billion initial public offering in 2007 and private again in 2016, at a valuation of $6.5 billion. Significantly growing the total addressable market by executing over 50 acquisitions during his tenure, it employed 7,000 people in more than 90 countries.
In 2019, based on his proven track record of 70+ transactions with $15bn+ in aggregate value and an industry leading return profile, Tony founded AFV Partners LLC, a long-term sustainable capital vehicle that invests globally in assets that contribute to a net positive impact on the environment.
Canoo is currently one of AFV’s significant investments. Tony initially agreed to provide rescue capital to the company in July 2020. This was followed by his participation in the PIPE. His investments in Canoo were based on his assessment of the company’s competitive advantage: its industry unique focus on proprietary engineering and technology. In preparations for the SPAC merger, Tony was asked to join the board and, effective with the completion of the merger and de-SPAC with Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp. IV in December 2020, became its Chairman. In April 2021, in the midst of maturing pains as a public company and the increased market scrutiny of SPAC businesses, particularly in the EV space, Tony accepted the CEO position, based on his deep belief in the design and engineering team, to accelerate the transformation of the business to set it apart from the herd. Since that time, Canoo expanded the executive team, announced three new vehicle trims, a Phase 1 advanced industrialization facility and established a landmark partnership for a Phase 2 owned mega-micro manufacturing facility on tribal land in Pryor, Oklahoma. Under Tony’s leadership the business grew to more than 700 engineers across five locations. He and his team are committed to their mission to bring EVs to everyone.
As part of the re-founding, Tony and the team have a “relentless and uncompromising” approach to innovation and are set to bring sustainable and purpose driven EVs to the hard-working people of the heartlands and beyond. He has a disciplined approach to “thinking differently” and he’s deeply rooted in his reverence for nature, affordable mobility for everyone, and helping businesses and teams succeed to make a lasting difference in the world.
On February 22, 2022, Tony was appointed by Governor Hutchinson to the Arkansas Council on Future Mobility, which includes representatives from Walmart, J.B. Hunt, the Arkansas Trucking and Auto Dealers Associations, the University of Arkansas and Southern Arkansas University Tech, and several state agencies, among others. The Council on Future Mobility has a goal to capitalize on advancements in mobility and further cement Arkansas as a national and global leader in the sector.

The recall affects various models, including the Model S (2012-2023), Model X (2016-2024), Model 3 (2017-2023), Model Y (2019-2024) and 2024 Cybertruck vehicles.
